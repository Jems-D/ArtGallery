Harvard Arts Explorer is an interactive web application that allows users to browse, search, and favorite artworks from the Harvard Art Museums. It also fetches real-time art-related news using the **Current News API**. Built with **React (TypeScript)** on the frontend and **ASP.NET Core Web API** on the backend, with **JWT authentication** for secure access.

üîíTo keep API keys and sensitive config values secure, this project uses environment variables.
This project uses **environment variables** to manage all sensitive data such as API keys, endpoints, and secrets. No credentials are hardcoded in the codebase. This ensures a secure and maintainable approach for both development and production environments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Frontend (React + Vite)

Environment variables are stored in a `.env` file located at the root of the frontend (`/frontend`) directory.
You will have to create a .env for it to work

### Example `.env` file:

```env
 Base URL of the ASP.NET Core Web API
VITE_API_URL_AUTH_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/api/Auth
VITE_API_URL_NEWS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/api/news
VITE_API_URL_MUSUEM_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/api/search
VITE_API_URL_MUSUEM_REVIEW_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/api/review
VITE_API_URL_MUSUEM_FAVORITE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/api/favourites

```

# üîê ASP.NET Core Environment Variable Configuration

This project uses **environment variables** to securely manage sensitive information such as:

- API keys (e.g., Harvard Art Museum API, Currents News API)

Environment variables are stored at root of the api ('/api') directory

No secrets are hardcoded in code or checked into version control.

```env
HARVARD_MUSEUM_API_KEY=apikey
HARVARD_MUSEUM_API_KEY=apikey
```

The connection string and the JWT, signing key, issuer, and audience, are also not hardcoded, but a template is provided in ## appsettings.Development.json ##

You will have to create a appsettings.json file for it to work
